# Wild Barley Introgression
##Searching for runs of indentity by state (IBS) in introgressed wild barley

- Wild barley lines often show introgression from cultivated barley. However it is not clear \
    how large the regions of introgression are or if they occur randomly across the genome.

- We have BOPA1 & BOPA2 and genotype by sequencing (GBS) data for all 318 lines in the sample \
    the Wild Barley Diversity Collection. There is exome capture resequencing for ~100 lines.

- Lines thought to be introgressed:
    WBDC027
    WBDC045
    WBDC172
    WBDC182
    WBDC190
    WBDC227
    WBDC311
    WBDC344

- It would also be worth looking for high IBS to cultivated lines in wild barley from \
    Azerbaijan and similar regions where the phenotype is most similar to cultivated barley. \
    This would include:
    WBDC150
    WBDC205
    WBDC217
    WBDC227
    WBDC228
    WBDC229
    WBDC231
    WBDC232
    
- The file "genotype.hmp.txt" is barley 9K iSelect genotyping from the Wild Barley NAM population [paper](http://www.genetics.org/content/203/3/1453).
    - The line listed as "M109" is Rasmusson. It was the recurrent parent in the experiment.
