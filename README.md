# Wild Barley Introgression
## Searching for runs of indentity by state (IBS) in introgressed wild barley

- Wild barley lines often show introgression from cultivated barley. However it is not clear \
    how large the regions of introgression are or if they occur randomly across the genome.

- We have BOPA1 & BOPA2 and genotype by sequencing (GBS) data for all 318 lines in the sample \
    the Wild Barley Diversity Collection. There is exome capture resequencing for ~100 lines.

- Lines thought to be introgressed:
    WBDC027
    WBDC045
    WBDC172
    WBDC182
    WBDC190
    WBDC227
    WBDC311
    WBDC344

- Introgressed lines in Liana's Population (Nice et al. 2016)

    **Update 2018-04-02:** finished realigning remaining 2 bam files below

    We have exome capture resequencing data for these lines. 5 out of 7 of the lines \
    below have already been read mapped and realigned. The 2 samples that still need \
    to be read mapped are in **bold**. The `*finished_realigned_reheader.bam` files are located in \
    `/home/morrellp/liux1299/Shared/Projects/Introgressed/sequence_handling/LianaPop_introgressed/realigned`
   - WBDC_016
   - **WBDC_092**
   - WBDC_172
   - WBDC_173
   - WBDC_182
   - WBDC_227
   - **WBDC_350**

- It would also be worth looking for high IBS to cultivated lines in wild barley from \
    Azerbaijan and similar regions where the phenotype is most similar to cultivated barley. \
    This would include:
    WBDC150
    WBDC205
    WBDC217
    WBDC227
    WBDC228
    WBDC229
    WBDC231
    WBDC232
