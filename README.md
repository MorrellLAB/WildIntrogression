# WildIntrogression
Searching for runs of indentity by state (IBS) in introgressed wild barley

- Wild barley lines often show introgression from cultivated barley. However it is not clear \
    how large the regions of introgression are or if they occur randomly across the genome.
- We have BOPA1 & BOPA2 and genotype by sequencing (GBS) data for all 318 lines in the sample \
    the Wild Barley Diversity Collection. There is exome capture resequencing for ~100 lines.
- It would also be worth looking for high IBS to cultivated lines in wild barley from \
    Azerbaijan and similar regions where the phenotype is most similar to cultivated barley. \
    This would include:
    WBDC 150
    WBDC 205
    WBDC 217
    WBDC 227
    WBDC 228
    WBDC 229
    WBDC 231
    WBDC 232
    

- Lines thought to be introgressed:
    WBDC 027
    WBDC 045
    WBDC 172
    WBDC 182
    WBDC 190
    WBDC 227
    WBDC 311
    WBDC 344

- The file "genotype.hmp.txt" is barley 9K iSelect genotyping from the Wild Barley NAM population [paper](http://www.genetics.org/content/203/3/1453).
