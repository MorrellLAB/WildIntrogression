# Genotype imputation and phasing

Impute and phase genotypes for running downstream analyses, such as ABBA-BABA/fd tests, FLARE for local ancestry inferences, etc.

We'll try a couple of software and see if observed heterozygosity gets inflated given the assumptions before deciding which imputed dataset we go with.
