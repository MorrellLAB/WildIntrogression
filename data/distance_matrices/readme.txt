This directory contains the distance matrices outputted by mergehmpvcf.sh, 
as well as distance matrices derived from the original by only taking a 
selection of domesticated samples, and finally associated lists of samples which
 have the same name as the distance matrices they list, 
but with a different extension (.mibs.id or .dist.id)
