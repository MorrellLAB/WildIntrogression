# WBDC Phenotype Data Analysis

WBDC phenotype data from Brian Steffenson's lab. Use to help identify lines that show some possible introgression traits. We'll include these lines in our analysis of local introgression.

Phenotypes data stored in Dropbox:

```bash
~/Dropbox/Projects/Wild_Introgression/Data/Phenotype_Data-Brian_Steffenson
